# InfiniteMemoryMCP Implementation Status

## Session 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)

- [x] Project setup and directory structure
- [x] Configuration management system
- [x] Logging setup
- [x] MongoDB connection management (both embedded and external modes)
- [x] MCP protocol server implementation
- [x] Basic MCP command handlers (ping, get_memory_stats)
- [x] Test infrastructure with MockMongoDB for testing without a real database
- [x] Unit tests for core components

## Session 2: Memory Storage & Retrieval (Completed)

- [x] Memory data models
- [x] Memory storage operations
- [x] Memory retrieval operations
- [x] Memory search functionality
- [x] Embedding generation for semantic search
- [x] MCP commands for memory storage and retrieval

## Session 3: Memory Scopes & Tags (Completed)

- [x] Scope management
- [x] Tag management
- [x] Filtering memories by scope and tags
- [x] MCP commands for scope and tag operations

## Session 4: Integration & Optimization (Completed)

- [x] Complete MCP protocol integration with error handling
- [x] Performance optimizations for database queries
- [x] Error handling and recovery mechanisms with circuit breaker pattern
- [x] Asynchronous processing implementation for embeddings
- [x] Database optimization features
- [x] Health check and monitoring commands
- [x] End-to-end testing for async features and error handling

## Session 5: Conversation History & Summaries (Completed)

- [x] Conversation history storage
- [x] Conversation summarization
- [x] MCP commands for conversation history

## Session 6: Final Testing & Documentation (In Progress)

- [x] Fixed async embedding test failures
- [x] Fixed logging test failures
- [x] Remaining comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, and system tests)
- [x] User documentation and guides
- [x] API documentation for MCP integration
- [x] Final code review and quality assurance

## Post-Launch: Memory Management & Maintenance (Deferred)

- [ ] Backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Time-based pruning implementation
- [ ] Memory usage statistics and monitoring

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Currently, the system requires MongoDB to be pre-installed when using external mode
- The embedded MongoDB mode requires mongod to be available in the system PATH
- Some advanced MongoDB features (like vector search) may require MongoDB 6.0+

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining testing and documentation (Session 6)
2. Develop conversation history storage and summarization functionality (Session 5)
3. Post-launch: Implement memory management features including backup, pruning, and monitoring
