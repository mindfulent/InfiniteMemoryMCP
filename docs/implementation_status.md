# InfiniteMemoryMCP Implementation Status

## Session 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)

- [x] Project setup and directory structure
- [x] Configuration management system
- [x] Logging setup
- [x] MongoDB connection management (both embedded and external modes)
- [x] MCP protocol server implementation
- [x] Basic MCP command handlers (ping, get_memory_stats)
- [x] Test infrastructure with MockMongoDB for testing without a real database
- [x] Unit tests for core components

## Session 2: Memory Storage & Retrieval (Completed)

- [x] Memory data models
- [x] Memory storage operations
- [x] Memory retrieval operations
- [x] Memory search functionality
- [x] Embedding generation for semantic search
- [x] MCP commands for memory storage and retrieval

## Session 3: Memory Scopes & Tags (Completed)

- [x] Scope management
- [x] Tag management
- [x] Filtering memories by scope and tags
- [x] MCP commands for scope and tag operations

## Session 4: Conversation History & Summaries (Pending)

- [ ] Conversation history storage
- [ ] Conversation summarization
- [ ] MCP commands for conversation history

## Session 5: Advanced Features & Optimizations (Pending)

- [ ] Backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] User preferences and settings

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Currently, the system requires MongoDB to be pre-installed when using external mode
- The embedded MongoDB mode requires mongod to be available in the system PATH
- Some advanced MongoDB features (like vector search) may require MongoDB 6.0+

## Next Steps

1. Implement conversation history storage and summarization functionality (Session 4)
2. Develop backup and restore capabilities
3. Add performance optimizations
4. Implement user preferences and settings management
