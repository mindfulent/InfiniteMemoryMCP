# InfiniteMemoryMCP Implementation Status

## Session 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)

- [x] Project setup and directory structure
- [x] Configuration management system
- [x] Logging setup
- [x] MongoDB connection management (both embedded and external modes)
- [x] MCP protocol server implementation
- [x] Basic MCP command handlers (ping, get_memory_stats)
- [x] Test infrastructure with MockMongoDB for testing without a real database
- [x] Unit tests for core components

## Session 2: Memory Storage & Retrieval (Pending)

- [ ] Memory data models
- [ ] Memory storage operations
- [ ] Memory retrieval operations
- [ ] Memory search functionality
- [ ] Embedding generation for semantic search
- [ ] MCP commands for memory storage and retrieval

## Session 3: Memory Scopes & Tags (Pending)

- [ ] Scope management
- [ ] Tag management
- [ ] Filtering memories by scope and tags
- [ ] MCP commands for scope and tag operations

## Session 4: Conversation History & Summaries (Pending)

- [ ] Conversation history storage
- [ ] Conversation summarization
- [ ] MCP commands for conversation history

## Session 5: Advanced Features & Optimizations (Pending)

- [ ] Backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] User preferences and settings

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Currently, the system requires MongoDB to be pre-installed when using external mode
- The embedded MongoDB mode requires mongod to be available in the system PATH
- Some advanced MongoDB features (like vector search) may require MongoDB 6.0+

## Next Steps

1. Implement memory storage and retrieval functionality (Session 2)
2. Develop the embedding generation for semantic search
3. Add MCP commands for storing and retrieving memories
4. Implement comprehensive test cases for memory operations
