# InfiniteMemoryMCP Implementation Status

## Session 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)

- [x] Project setup and directory structure
- [x] Configuration management system
- [x] Logging setup
- [x] MongoDB connection management (both embedded and external modes)
- [x] MCP protocol server implementation
- [x] Basic MCP command handlers (ping, get_memory_stats)
- [x] Test infrastructure with MockMongoDB for testing without a real database
- [x] Unit tests for core components

## Session 2: Memory Storage & Retrieval (Completed)

- [x] Memory data models
- [x] Memory storage operations
- [x] Memory retrieval operations
- [x] Memory search functionality
- [x] Embedding generation for semantic search
- [x] MCP commands for memory storage and retrieval

## Session 3: Memory Scopes & Tags (Completed)

- [x] Scope management
- [x] Tag management
- [x] Filtering memories by scope and tags
- [x] MCP commands for scope and tag operations

## Session 4: Integration & Optimization (Pending)

- [ ] Complete MCP protocol integration
- [ ] Performance optimizations 
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Asynchronous processing implementation
- [ ] End-to-end testing

## Post-Launch: Conversation History & Summaries (Deferred)

- [ ] Conversation history storage
- [ ] Conversation summarization
- [ ] MCP commands for conversation history

## Post-Launch: Memory Management & Maintenance (Deferred)

- [ ] Backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Time-based pruning implementation
- [ ] Memory usage statistics and monitoring

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Currently, the system requires MongoDB to be pre-installed when using external mode
- The embedded MongoDB mode requires mongod to be available in the system PATH
- Some advanced MongoDB features (like vector search) may require MongoDB 6.0+

## Next Steps

1. Implement integration and optimization functionality (Session 4)
2. Complete final testing and documentation (Session 5)
3. Post-launch: Develop conversation history storage and summarization functionality
4. Post-launch: Implement memory management features including backup, pruning, and monitoring
