# InfiniteMemoryMCP Product Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the product requirements for InfiniteMemoryMCP, a MongoDB-powered persistent memory system for Claude Desktop. The system enables Claude to maintain context and recall information across conversations through a local-first architecture.

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

### Core System

#### Local Memory Architecture
**User Story:** As a Claude Desktop user, I want all my interaction data stored locally so that my privacy is maintained and I have full control over my data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No conversation data leaves the user's device
- MongoDB database runs entirely locally
- System does not require internet connection to store or retrieve memories
- All data is accessible/manageable from the user's local machine

#### Setup and Configuration
**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple way to set up and configure InfiniteMemoryMCP so that I can start using it without extensive technical knowledge.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System can be installed alongside Claude Desktop with minimal configuration
- Default configuration works out-of-the-box
- First-time setup guide explains memory capabilities and privacy implications
- Configuration options for database location and memory limits are accessible

### Memory Storage and Organization

#### Conversation Memory
**User Story:** As a user, I want Claude to remember our previous conversations so that I don't have to repeat information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System records and stores all conversation exchanges
- Claude can recall specific details from past conversations when asked
- Conversations maintain correct attribution (user vs. assistant)
- Stored conversations include timestamps for chronological reference

#### User Profile and Preferences
**User Story:** As a user, I want Claude to remember my preferences and personal details so that interactions are more personalized.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System maintains a profile with user-specific information
- Claude recalls personal details without prompting (e.g., "As you mentioned before, your favorite color is blue")
- User can explicitly add information to profile with commands like "Remember that my favorite color is blue"
- Profile information persists across conversation sessions

#### Memory Scopes
**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize Claude's memory into different contexts so that information doesn't bleed inappropriately between different topics or projects.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System supports global and contextual memory scopes
- User can create and name custom memory scopes
- Claude only recalls information from relevant scopes by default
- User can explicitly request cross-scope memory access when needed
- Information stored within a scope doesn't appear in unrelated contexts

#### Memory Tagging
**User Story:** As a user, I want to tag specific memories so that I can organize and retrieve information more efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can assign tags to any stored information
- Claude can retrieve information by tag with queries like "What do you remember about #project-alpha?"
- Tags are searchable across all memory scopes
- System suggests relevant tags based on content

### Memory Retrieval

#### Semantic Search
**User Story:** As a user, I want Claude to understand what I'm asking about even if I phrase it differently than before so that retrieval feels natural.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Claude retrieves memories based on semantic meaning, not just keywords
- System generates and stores vector embeddings for all memories
- Similar concepts are linked even when using different phrasing
- Claude can find information related to a topic even if exact terms weren't used

#### Time-Based Recall
**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask Claude about conversations from specific time periods so that I can find information chronologically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Claude understands natural language time references (e.g., "last week," "yesterday")
- User can query memories from specific dates or date ranges
- Results include timestamps showing when the information was originally discussed
- Recent memories can be prioritized over older memories when appropriate

#### Contextual Association
**User Story:** As a user, I want Claude to automatically connect related pieces of information over time so that conversation feels continuous.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Claude recognizes when current topics relate to previous conversations
- System proactively surfaces relevant past information when context suggests it's useful
- Claude maintains the thread of ongoing projects across multiple sessions
- Related memories from different time periods can be linked together

### Memory Management

#### Memory Pruning
**User Story:** As a user, I want Claude's memory to stay relevant and manageable so that performance remains optimal.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System has configurable policies for managing memory growth
- Old, unused memories are automatically summarized or archived
- User can specify retention preferences (e.g., "Keep all conversations for 6 months")
- Pruning preserves important information while removing low-value details

#### Forgetting Information
**User Story:** As a user, I want the ability to have Claude forget specific information so that I maintain control over what's remembered.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can issue forget commands for specific pieces of information
- User can delete entire memory scopes if desired
- System confirms when information has been forgotten
- Forgotten information no longer surfaces in conversation unless re-introduced

#### Memory Export and Backup
**User Story:** As a user, I want to back up Claude's memory so that I won't lose important information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System performs automatic, scheduled backups
- User can trigger manual backups
- Backups are stored locally in a user-accessible format
- User can restore from backups if database becomes corrupted
- Optional encryption for backup files is available

### System Integration

#### Claude Desktop Integration
**User Story:** As a user, I want InfiniteMemoryMCP to integrate seamlessly with Claude Desktop so that I don't need to manage separate applications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Memory features are accessed through normal conversation with Claude
- No special syntax is required for basic memory operations
- Claude recognizes memory-related requests automatically
- Performance impact on Claude Desktop is minimal

#### MCP Protocol Support
**User Story:** As a developer, I want InfiniteMemoryMCP to follow the MCP protocol so that it's compatible with future Claude updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System implements all required MCP interfaces
- Memory operations are exposed through standard MCP operations
- MCP server responds appropriately to all defined memory commands
- New MCP protocol versions are supported with backward compatibility
