# InfiniteMemoryMCP Implementation Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project plan outlines the implementation strategy for InfiniteMemoryMCP, a MongoDB-powered persistent memory system for Claude Desktop. The system enables Claude to maintain context and recall information across conversations through a local-first architecture, ensuring privacy while providing "infinite" memory capabilities.

## Implementation Approach
The implementation will follow an incremental, session-based approach with each development session delivering testable functionality. This allows us to validate core components early while building toward the complete system. Each session will include:

1. Development of specified components
2. Unit tests for individual components
3. Integration tests between components
4. Documentation of completed functionality
5. Code review and quality assurance

## Development Sessions Overview
- **Session 1**: Core Infrastructure [TODO]
- **Session 2**: Memory Storage & Basic Retrieval [TODO]
- **Session 3**: Semantic Search & Advanced Retrieval [TODO]
- **Session 4**: Integration & Optimization [TODO]
- **Session 5**: Final Testing & Documentation [TODO]
- **Post-Launch**: Memory Management & Maintenance [PAUSE] [DO-NOT-DO]
